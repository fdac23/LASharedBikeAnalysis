### Analysis

  Shared-bike riders usually choose to start their trip at 7a.m.-23p.m.
  
  7am.-10am.morning peak period, 10a.m.-13a.m.afternoon peak period and 16a.m.-18a.m.evening peak period shows significant increase in shared-bike use
  
  The peak of use is 18p.m., which is presumed to be the evening peak
  
  The lowest point of use is 4a.m,few shared-bikes are used in mid-night
  
  From the peak to the lowest point is a complete downward trend, with the vehicle gradually reduced

  The proportion of users with membership cards for One Way Trip's shared bicycles is very high, accounting for over 70%. Most of them are monthly card holders.
  
  The majority of Round Trip's shared bicycle users are casual users, with only thirty percent having membership cards, and most of these members are also monthly card holders.

  The majority of users who use shared-bikes for a very-long-time are those who use them immediately.
  
  Over 60% of users who use shared-bikes for a short-time are those who possess Monthly-Pass.Log
  
  The percentage of those who possess Flex-Pass among short-time trip bike users is also the highest among all types.

  Based on the mean, median, and upper and lower quartiles in the table above, it is evident that the duration of use for Round Trip bicycles is generally longer than that of One Way 
  Trip bicycles, which is consistent with expectations.
